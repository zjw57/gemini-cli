## Non-interactive mode

Gemini CLI can be run in a non-interactive mode, which is useful for scripting and automation. In this mode, you pipe input to the CLI, it executes the command, and then it exits.

The following example pipes a command to Gemini CLI from your terminal:

```bash
echo "What is fine tuning?" | gemini
```

You can also use the `--prompt` or `-p` flag:

```bash
gemini -p "What is fine tuning?"
```

For comprehensive documentation on headless usage, scripting, automation, and advanced examples, see the **[Headless Mode](../headless.md)** guide.
