# CLI Commands

Gemini CLI supports several built-in commands to help you manage your session,
customize the interface, and control its behavior. These commands are prefixed
with a forward slash (`/`), an at symbol (`@`), or an exclamation mark (`!`).

## Slash commands (`/`)

Slash commands provide meta-level control over the CLI itself.

### Built-in Commands

- **`/bug`**
  - **Description:** File an issue about Gemini CLI. By default, the issue is
    filed within the GitHub repository for Gemini CLI. The string you enter
    after `/bug` will become the headline for the bug being filed. The default
    `/bug` behavior can be modified using the `advanced.bugCommand` setting in
    your `.gemini/settings.json` files.

- **`/chat`**
  - **Description:** Save and resume conversation history for branching
    conversation state interactively, or resuming a previous state from a later
    session.
  - **Sub-commands:**
    - **`save`**
      - **Description:** Saves the current conversation history. You must add a
        `<tag>` for identifying the conversation state.
      - **Usage:** `/chat save <tag>`
      - **Details on Checkpoint Location:** The default locations for saved chat
        checkpoints are:
        - Linux/macOS: `~/.gemini/tmp/<project_hash>/`
        - Windows: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.gemini\tmp\<project_hash>\`
        - When you run `/chat list`, the CLI only scans these specific
          directories to find available checkpoints.
        - **Note:** These checkpoints are for manually saving and resuming
          conversation states. For automatic checkpoints created before file
          modifications, see the
          [Checkpointing documentation](../cli/checkpointing.md).
    - **`resume`**
      - **Description:** Resumes a conversation from a previous save.
      - **Usage:** `/chat resume <tag>`
    - **`list`**
      - **Description:** Lists available tags for chat state resumption.
    - **`delete`**
      - **Description:** Deletes a saved conversation checkpoint.
      - **Usage:** `/chat delete <tag>`
    - **`share`**
      - **Description** Writes the current conversation to a provided Markdown
        or JSON file.
      - **Usage** `/chat share file.md` or `/chat share file.json`. If no
        filename is provided, then the CLI will generate one.

- **`/clear`**
  - **Description:** Clear the terminal screen, including the visible session
    history and scrollback within the CLI. The underlying session data (for
    history recall) might be preserved depending on the exact implementation,
    but the visual display is cleared.
  - **Keyboard shortcut:** Press **Ctrl+L** at any time to perform a clear
    action.

- **`/compress`**
  - **Description:** Replace the entire chat context with a summary. This saves
    on tokens used for future tasks while retaining a high level summary of what
    has happened.

- **`/copy`**
  - **Description:** Copies the last output produced by Gemini CLI to your
    clipboard, for easy sharing or reuse.
  - **Note:** This command requires platform-specific clipboard tools to be
    installed.
    - On Linux, it requires `xclip` or `xsel`. You can typically install them
      using your system's package manager.
    - On macOS, it requires `pbcopy`, and on Windows, it requires `clip`. These
      tools are typically pre-installed on their respective systems.

- **`/directory`** (or **`/dir`**)
  - **Description:** Manage workspace directories for multi-directory support.
  - **Sub-commands:**
    - **`add`**:
      - **Description:** Add a directory to the workspace. The path can be
        absolute or relative to the current working directory. Moreover, the
        reference from home directory is supported as well.
      - **Usage:** `/directory add <path1>,<path2>`
      - **Note:** Disabled in restrictive sandbox profiles. If you're using
        that, use `--include-directories` when starting the session instead.
    - **`show`**:
      - **Description:** Display all directories added by `/directory add` and
        `--include-directories`.
      - **Usage:** `/directory show`

- **`/editor`**
  - **Description:** Open a dialog for selecting supported editors.

- **`/extensions`**
  - **Description:** Lists all active extensions in the current Gemini CLI
    session. See [Gemini CLI Extensions](../extensions/index.md).

- **`/help`** (or **`/?`**)
  - **Description:** Display help information about Gemini CLI, including
    available commands and their usage.

- **`/mcp`**
  - **Description:** List configured Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, their

    showing and hiding tool descriptions.

- **`/memory`**
  - **Description:** Manage the AI's instructional context (hierarchical memory
    loaded from `GEMINI.md` files).
  - **Sub-commands:**
    - **`add`**:
      - **Description:** Adds the following text to the AI's memory. Usage:
        `/memory add <text to remember>`
    - **`show`**:
      - **Description:** Display the full, concatenated content of the current
        hierarchical memory that has been loaded from all `GEMINI.md` files.
        This lets you inspect the instructional context being provided to the
        Gemini model.
    - **`refresh`**:
      - **Description:** Reload the hierarchical instructional memory from all
        `GEMINI.md` files found in the configured locations (global,
        project/ancestors, and sub-directories). This command updates the model
        with the latest `GEMINI.md` content.
    - **`list`**:
      - **Description:** Lists the paths of the GEMINI.md files in use for
        hierarchical memory.

- **`/restore`**
  - **Description:** Restores the project files to the state they were in just
    before a tool was executed. This is particularly useful for undoing file
    edits made by a tool. If run without a tool call ID, it will list available
    checkpoints to restore from.
  - **Usage:** `/restore [tool_call_id]`
  - **Note:** Only available if the CLI is invoked with the `--checkpointing`
    option or configured via [settings](../get-started/configuration.md). See
    [Checkpointing documentation](../cli/checkpointing.md) for more details.

- **`/settings`**
  - **Description:** Open the settings editor to view and modify Gemini CLI
    settings.
  - **Details:** This command provides a user-friendly interface for changing
    settings that control the behavior and appearance of Gemini CLI. It is
    equivalent to manually editing the `.gemini/settings.json` file, but with
    validation and guidance to prevent errors.
  - **Usage:** Simply run `/settings` and the editor will open. You can then
    browse or search for specific settings, view their current values, and
    modify them as desired. Changes to some settings are applied immediately,
    while others require a restart.

- **`/stats`**
  - **Description:** Display detailed statistics for the current Gemini CLI
    session, including token usage, cached token savings (when available), and

  - **Description:** Toggle vim mode on or off. When vim mode is enabled, the
    input area supports vim-style navigation and editing commands in both NORMAL
    and INSERT modes.
  - **Features:**
    - **NORMAL mode:** Navigate with `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`; jump by words with `w`,

      with `G` (or `gg` for first line)
    - **INSERT mode:** Standard text input with escape to return to NORMAL mode
    - **Editing commands:** Delete with `x`, change with `c`, insert with `i`,
      `a`, `o`, `O`; complex operations like `dd`, `cc`, `dw`, `cw`

    footer

- **`/init`**
  - **Description:** To help users easily create a `GEMINI.md` file, this
    command analyzes the current directory and generates a tailored context
    file, making it simpler for them to provide project-specific instructions to
    the Gemini agent.

### Custom Commands

Custom commands allow you to create personalized shortcuts for your most-used
prompts. For detailed instructions on how to create, manage, and use them,
please see the dedicated [Custom Commands documentation](./custom-commands.md).

## Input Prompt Shortcuts

These shortcuts apply directly to the input prompt for text manipulation.

- **Undo:**
  - **Keyboard shortcut:** Press **Ctrl+z** to undo the last action in the input
    prompt.

- **Redo:**
  - **Keyboard shortcut:** Press **Ctrl+Shift+Z** to redo the last undone action
    in the input prompt.

## At commands (`@`)

At commands are used to include the content of files or directories as part of
your prompt to Gemini. These commands include git-aware filtering.

- **`@<path_to_file_or_directory>`**
  - **Description:** Inject the content of the specified file or files into your
    current prompt. This is useful for asking questions about specific code,
    text, or collections of files.
  - **Examples:**
    - `@path/to/your/file.txt Explain this text.`
    - `@src/my_project/ Summarize the code in this directory.`
    - `What is this file about? @README.md`
  - **Details:**
    - If a path to a single file is provided, the content of that file is read.
    - If a path to a directory is provided, the command attempts to read the
      content of files within that directory and any subdirectories.
    - Spaces in paths should be escaped with a backslash (e.g.,
      `@My\ Documents/file.txt`).
    - The command uses the `read_many_files` tool internally. The content is
      fetched and then inserted into your query before being sent to the Gemini
      model.
    - **Git-aware filtering:** By default, git-ignored files (like
      `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.env`, `.git/`) are excluded. This behavior can
      be changed via the `context.fileFiltering` settings.
    - **File types:** The command is intended for text-based files. While it
      might attempt to read any file, binary files or very large files might be
      skipped or truncated by the underlying `read_many_files` tool to ensure
      performance and relevance. The tool indicates if files were skipped.
  - **Output:** The CLI will show a tool call message indicating that
    `read_many_files` was used, along with a message detailing the status and
    the path(s) that were processed.

- **`@` (Lone at symbol)**
  - **Description:** If you type a lone `@` symbol without a path, the query is
    passed as-is to the Gemini model. This might be useful if you are
    specifically talking _about_ the `@` symbol in your prompt.

### Error handling for `@` commands

- If the path specified after `@` is not found or is invalid, an error message
  will be displayed, and the query might not be sent to the Gemini model, or it
  will be sent without the file content.
- If the `read_many_files` tool encounters an error (e.g., permission issues),
  this will also be reported.

## Shell mode & passthrough commands (`!`)

The `!` prefix lets you interact with your system's shell directly from within
Gemini CLI.

- **`!<shell_command>`**
  - **Description:** Execute the given `<shell_command>` using `bash` on
    Linux/macOS or `powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command` on Windows (unless you
    override `ComSpec`). Any output or errors from the command are displayed in
    the terminal.
  - **Examples:**
    - `!ls -la` (executes `ls -la` and returns to Gemini CLI)
    - `!git status` (executes `git status` and returns to Gemini CLI)

- **`!` (Toggle shell mode)**
  - **Description:** Typing `!` on its own toggles shell mode.
    - **Entering shell mode:**
      - When active, shell mode uses a different coloring and a "Shell Mode
        Indicator".
      - While in shell mode, text you type is interpreted directly as a shell
        command.
    - **Exiting shell mode:**
      - When exited, the UI reverts to its standard appearance and normal Gemini
        CLI behavior resumes.

- **Caution for all `!` usage:** Commands you execute in shell mode have the
  same permissions and impact as if you ran them directly in your terminal.

- **Environment Variable:** When a command is executed via `!` or in shell mode,
  the `GEMINI_CLI=1` environment variable is set in the subprocess's
  environment. This allows scripts or tools to detect if they are being run from
  within the Gemini CLI.
